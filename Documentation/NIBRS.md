### DOJ Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program: Crimes Against Persons, Property, and Society
https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs/2012/resources/crimes-against-persons-property-and-society

Each NIBRS offense belongs to one of three categories: Crimes Against Persons, Crimes Against Property, and Crimes Against Society. Crimes Against Persons, e.g., murder, rape, and assault, are those whose victims are always individuals. The object of Crimes Against Property, e.g.,robbery, bribery, and burglary, is to obtain money, property, or some other benefit. Crimes Against Society, e.g., gambling, prostitution, and drug violations, represent society’s prohibition against engaging in certain types of activity; they are typically victimless crimes in which property is not the object.

For counting purposes, agencies should count one offense for each victim of a Crime Against Person, one offense for each distinct operation of a Crime Against Property (with the exception of motor vehicle theft, where one offense is counted for each stolen vehicle), and one offense for each Crime Against Society.

In addition, each offense reported in the NIBRS is either a Group A or Group B offense type. There are 22 Group A offense categories comprised of 46 Group A offenses and 10 Group B offense categories including 10 Group B offenses. Law enforcement agencies report Group A offenses as part of a NIBRS incident report, but they report only arrest data for Group B offenses.

The listings of the Group A and Group B offenses appearing in this section indicate whether offenses are Crimes Against Persons, Property, or Society.

### Bureau of Justice Statistics: National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)

As of January 1, 2021, the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) became the national standard for law enforcement crime data reporting in the United States. The transition to NIBRS represents a significant shift – and improvement – in how reported crime is measured and estimated by the federal government.

NIBRS captures detailed data about the characteristics of criminal incidents, including:

- a broad array of offenses
- types and amount of property lost
- demographic information about victims, offenders, and persons arrested
- what type of weapon, if any, was used in the incident. 

NIBRS data more accurately reflect the types of crime addressed by police agencies, like simple assault, animal cruelty, destruction of property, intimidation, and identity theft. The broad scope of the information collected in NIBRS will greatly improve the nation’s understanding of crime and public safety.

Implemented to improve the overall quality of crime data collected by law enforcement, NIBRS captures details on each single crime incident—as well as on separate offenses within the same incident—including information on victims, known offenders, relationships between victims and offenders, arrestees, and property involved in crimes. 

Unlike data reported through the UCR Program’s traditional Summary Reporting System (SRS)—an aggregate monthly tally of crimes—NIBRS goes much deeper because of its ability to provide circumstances and context for crimes like location, time of day, and whether the incident was cleared (solved.)

As recommended by professional law enforcement organizations, the FBI has made nationwide implementation of NIBRS a top priority because NIBRS can provide more useful statistics to promote constructive discussion, measured planning, and informed policing. To increase participation, the UCR Program is partnering with the Bureau of Justice Statistics on the National Crime Statistics Exchange, working with advocacy groups to emphasize the importance of NIBRS data, and transitioned the UCR Program to a NIBRS-only data collection, as of Jan. 1, 2021. In addition, the UCR Program has made resources available to help agencies address the cost of transitioning, as well as the potential perception that an agency has higher crime levels when NIBRS actually establishes a new baseline that more precisely captures reported crime in a community.

**The Benefits of NIBRS**
When used to its full potential, NIBRS identifies, with precision, when and where crime takes place, what form it takes, and the characteristics of its victims and perpetrators. Armed with such information, law enforcement can better define the resources it needs to fight crime, as well as use those resources in the most efficient and effective manner. NIBRS:

- **Provides greater specificity in reporting offenses.** Not only does NIBRS look at all of the offenses within an incident, but it also looks at many more offenses than the traditional SRS does. NIBRS collects data for 52 offenses, plus 10 additional offenses for which only arrests are reported. SRS counts limited data for 10 offenses and 20 additional crimes for which only arrests are reported.
  
- **Collects more detailed information**, including incident date and time, whether reported offenses were attempted or completed, expanded victim types, relationships of victims to offenders and offenses, demographic details, location data, property descriptions, drug types and quantities, the offender’s suspected use of drugs or alcohol, the involvement of gang activity, and whether a computer was used in the commission of the crime.
  
- **Helps give context to specific crime problems** such as drug/narcotics and sex offenses, as well as issues like animal cruelty, identity theft, and computer hacking.
  
- **Provides greater analytic flexibility.** Through NIBRS, data users can see many more facets of crime, as well as relationships and connections among these facets, than SRS provides.
